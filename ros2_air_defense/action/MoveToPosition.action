# MoveToPosition.action - Action for moving motors to a specific position

# Goal
float32 target_azimuth     # Target azimuth angle (-180 to +180 degrees)
float32 target_elevation   # Target elevation angle (-90 to +90 degrees)
float32 movement_speed     # Movement speed (0.0-1.0, 1.0=max speed)
bool synchronized         # True if both motors should move together
float32 position_tolerance # Acceptable position error (degrees)
builtin_interfaces/Duration max_movement_time # Maximum time allowed for movement
bool track_target         # True if continuously tracking a moving target
uint32 target_id          # ID of target being tracked (if track_target=true)

# Result
bool success              # True if position was reached successfully
float32 final_azimuth     # Final azimuth position achieved
float32 final_elevation   # Final elevation position achieved
float32 position_error    # Final position error (degrees)
builtin_interfaces/Duration movement_time # Total time taken for movement
string result_message     # Human readable result message
bool position_within_tolerance # True if final position is within tolerance

float32 movement_progress # Overall movement progress (0.0-1.0)
float32 estimated_time_remaining # Estimated time to complete (seconds)
bool azimuth_moving       # True if azimuth motor is currently moving
bool elevation_moving     # True if elevation motor is currently moving
string status_message     # Current movement status
